I believe Yorgos Lanthimos went to see Barbie (and skipped Oppenheimer) and he quite liked it, but not one second did he think: "man, this is really similar to *my* latest work," because Poor Things[^1] is not Barbie[^2]. It also isn't the better Barbie. Sure, there are parallels: while Barbie learns some harsh truths about the world by encountering teenage girls in high school, hearing about the exhaustion of working a minimum wage job and gaining perspective about the inner workings of a large cooperation, Bella does so by enjoying the heat and temptations of Lisbon, suffering the sight of slaves in a ditch in Alexandria and battling the bleakness of Paris. And you could argue, that that's pretty much the same thing. But I would say, they are not that similar at all, especially in terms of vibes!

Poor Things really lures you in with its unique look: starting with fish-eye heavy black and white images and then transitioning to beautiful and vivid, Wes Anderson-esque set designs, mesmerizing painted skies and truly gorgeous title cards, all accompanied by an incredible score and sound design, it's hard not to get captivated by it. But there are some truly weird parts, that even its pretty looks cannot make you overlook.
For the most part I was surprised, in a good way, that a male director is able to so accurately tell a story about the female experience. But at a certain point you can't ignore all the slightly weird shit anymore and it starts falling apart: the confrontation with the thesis that sex work is *the* way of female empowerment just feels frustratingly predictable. And then lucky for Bella, her betrothed still wants her, even though she has slept with other men. It made me want to leave. 
And yet, there are also many great things; it's just really quite challenging and so full of ambivalence. It's sort of what makes it enjoyable, I guess and it's also what characterizes Lanthimos' other works.

Poor Things winks at you non-stop. At times that feels seductive, empowering, inspiring and charming. And then sometimes, it's just so, so icky!
